.Nd network management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm networkd
.Op Fl s Ar path
.Op Fl u Ar username
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon responds to command lines sent on its control socket, located at
.Pa /var/run/networkd.sock
by default. It allows non-root users to configure network interfaces in
simple ways, and logs network interface readiness events into the hardware
event log at
.Pa /var/run/hwevents .
.Sh HARDWARE EVENT LOG
Whenever a network interface's link state changes,
.Nm networkd
will log either of the following lines to
.Pa /var/run/hwevents :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
up <interface>
down <interface>
.Ed
.Sh PROTOCOL
.Nm networkd
speaks a line-oriented JSON protocol on its control socket. Each line
contains a JSON array, starting with a command, followed by arguments.
.Nm networkd
will respond with a JSON array starting with either "ok" or "error".

Any of the following commands are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It \[bu]
.Nm list
.It \[bu]
.Nm configure
.Ar <interface> <stanza>...
.It \[bu]
.Nm connect
.Ar <interface>
.It \[bu]
.Nm disconnect
.Ar <interface>

syntax, only allowing the
.Pa inet ,
.Pa inet6 ,
.Pa dhcp ,
.Pa rtsol ,
.Pa nwid ,

and

stanzas.
